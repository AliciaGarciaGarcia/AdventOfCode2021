As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.
To do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.

**How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?**

--- [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1#part2https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1#part2) ---

Considering every single measurement isn't as useful as you expected: there's just too much noise in the data.

Instead, consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window.
Start by comparing the first and second three-measurement windows.
